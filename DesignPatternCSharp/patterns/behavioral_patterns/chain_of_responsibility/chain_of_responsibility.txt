Chain of Responsibility

Intent
Pass requests along a chain of handlers
Handlers decide to process or pass it to next handler


Example 
Online ordering systems 
Restrict access to authenticated users 
Checks happen sequentially 
Transform certain behaviors into stand-alond handler objects 
Each handler has a field that references the next handler 
Each handler can execute primary behavior 
All handlers should implement the same interface
Use handlers with out coupling them to concrete classes 



Handler - declares interface 

Base Handler - optional class 

Concrete Handler - actual code for processing request 

Client
