1. General Improvements

done - Separation of Concerns (SoC):
The Main method handles both user input and design pattern logic. Extract the menu logic into separate classes or methods for better modularity.
Consider creating a MenuManager class to handle all menu-related tasks.

done - Dependency Injection:
Use dependency injection to manage dependencies like ShapeManager or other components. This improves testability and decouples dependencies.


Error Handling:
Add error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric entries). Use try-catch blocks or input validation to avoid crashes.

2. Behavioral Pattern Handling
State Pattern Implementation Placeholder:
Instead of displaying a placeholder message, create a basic implementation or stub to encourage completion later.
Reflection or Factory Pattern for Dynamic Pattern Selection:
Instead of hardcoding cases for patterns, use reflection or a factory pattern to dynamically load and run the selected pattern class. This makes it easier to add new patterns without modifying the existing menu logic.

3. Creational Pattern Handling
Implement Patterns:
Provide basic implementations for the Builder and Singleton patterns to showcase their functionality.

4. Structural Pattern Handling
Implement Patterns:
Similarly, implement basic versions of Adapter and Decorator patterns.

5. Shape Hierarchy Enhancements
Validation for Shapes:

Ensure proper validation for input values (e.g., side lengths in Triangle must satisfy the triangle inequality).
Encapsulation:

Make properties private or protected and expose them through public methods or properties to follow proper encapsulation.
Immutability:

Make shapes immutable by removing setters from properties. Pass required values through the constructor.
Add More Shapes:

Extend the hierarchy with additional shapes like Square, Ellipse, or Polygon.
Support for 3D Shapes:

Extend the hierarchy to support 3D shapes like Sphere, Cube, or Cylinder using interfaces like IThreeDimensionalShape.
6. Program Output Improvements
Formatting Output:
Format the output better for readability. Use string.Format or interpolation to ensure uniform spacing and alignment.
Dynamic Shape Display:
Display details dynamically using reflection to list all available Shape implementations.
7. Code Structure and Maintainability
Namespace and Folder Structure:

Organize classes into appropriate folders based on their functionality (BehavioralPatterns, CreationalPatterns, StructuralPatterns, InterviewQuestions, etc.).
Unit Tests:

Write unit tests for the Shape hierarchy and pattern implementations to ensure correctness and maintainability.
Code Comments and Documentation:

Add XML comments for methods, classes, and properties to describe their purpose.
Interface for Shapes:

Introduce an interface, IShape, to represent the contract for shapes. This makes the system more extensible and allows the addition of new shapes without modifying the base classes.
8. Performance Enhancements
Optimize Shape Calculation:
Cache results for computationally expensive operations like CalculateArea() if the shape’s properties don’t change.
9. User Experience
Command-Line Arguments:

Allow users to pass design pattern choices as command-line arguments for automation or scripting.
Better Input Handling:

Provide meaningful prompts for invalid inputs and offer re-entry options without restarting the program.
